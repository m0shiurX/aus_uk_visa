                                                An Electronic Travel Authority (Electronic Travel Authority) provides authorisation to travel to and enter Australia and
                                                is electronically linked to your passport. It is for short term stays for tourism or business visitor activities
                                                such as attending a conference, making business enquiries or for contractual negotiations. Business visitor activities
                                                do not include work. An Electronic Travel Authority is not a work visa. If you would like to work in Australia

                                                which makes it take much longer than expected. Should your application is not approved in time, check it again
